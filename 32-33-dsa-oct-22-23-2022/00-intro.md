## Data Structures and Algorithms
- Data structure - how to structure data. how we structure data depends on the problem we are trying to solve
- Algorithm - step-by-step solution to a problem

We study DSA to come up with efficient ways to solve a problem

- Searching: You are given a collection of values. And you need to find a value.
