## Database
- Relational DB (SQL) - Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL - store data in the form of "tables" - very structured

...
- Non-relational (NoSQL) - semi-structured
    - MongoDB
        - Documents
            - {
                name: 'Mark,
                eid: 1001,
                role: 'CEO'
            }
            - {
