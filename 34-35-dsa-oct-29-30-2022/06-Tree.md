# Trees
- Tree is a non-linear data structure
- A set of Nodes. Every Node can have a set of children that it is linked to. There is the concept of parent node and child node.
- Great for representing hierarchies
- There is a "distinguished node" - called "root" - the root has no parent node
- Example
    - An organization chart
    - DOM tree in a browser that represents the HTML page elements
    - Abstract Syntax Tree - a representation of the code of a program
    - Some Searching and Sorting algorithms represent data in a tree data structure
        - Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Operations:
    - Searching for a node with matching data
    - Listing out nodes (data) in the tree
