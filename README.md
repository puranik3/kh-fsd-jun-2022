    - On Prism
        - Solve the exercises on the important topics (shared by instructor, and which are mostly the same topics covered in the live classes).
    - Shared by instructor
        - 05-React - Lab guide (high priority)
            - Try completing as many exercises
            - Focus on the Todo List app (pages 10 - 14)

            - If you are not clear with some JS concept, watch the Prism videos on the topics, pick an exercise from the Lab guide and solve it
- Capstone project
    - React - work on this first (MOST IMPORTANT) - Avoid the PRISM React Capstone project for now. You can complete it later (end of training) to meet the certification requirements.

                - You can find these in /documents/small-projects folder in GitHub repo
            - SECOND PRIORITY: Large project - /documents/large-project/meetings-app
                - Please go through this document by Friday
    - HTML and CSS - work on this second
- Final assessments on Prism (NOT IMPORTANT)
    - JavaScript - take it up (take it up first)
